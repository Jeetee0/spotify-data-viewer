export const infoText = `This is mostly a private project of the DJ 'Kinetic Energy' (KE). He uses it to manage his spotify playlists (Playlist State), 
  check for new tracks in his playlists (Playlist Diff) and sometimes also to see his favorite tracks (Spotify user data).
  
  This is a structured approach to keep track of all different kinds of electronic music tracks and sort them into playlist that reflect genres & moods.
  A lot of playlists can all be viewed at his <a href=https://open.spotify.com/user/jeetee0>Spotify page</a>.
  From time to time fitting tracks will then be crafted into a mix which will be upload onto his <a href=https://soundcloud.com/kineticenergyberlin>Soundcloud page</a>.

  In the background there is a music data library which consists of all the tracks and artists that he has in his playlists.
  You can manually import your favorite tracks, artists and playlists into the librabry with the import feature (still work in progress).

  After that you can check the general features 'Artist & Genre' to have some insights on how Spotify classifies Artists, which genres they belong to etc.
  Also you can use the 'Discover' feature to explore new music based on similar artists, genres & tracks and some more parameters.
